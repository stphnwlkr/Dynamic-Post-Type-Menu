# Dynamic Post Type Menu
 
This plugin adds a dropdown menu to the admin bar, creating quick access to all post types. If you are an admin or editor, you get all and my variations, and authors and contributors only see the "My Name of Post Type" option. Post types are presented in alphabetical order after the core Posts and Pages.
